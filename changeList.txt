Efficienty:
push todos at the lists front, this way the most recent will be accessed earlier and it has to loop over less todos

Date: 9-6-2019
+ Some minor improvements in the code
+ Fixed a bug where the 'overdue'-items wouldn't display their projectTitle
+ Updated the color of the bDefault-button to fit with the new colour scheme

Date: 25-5-2019
+ Fixed the MainContent.menu.Main.page system, it'd set the pagename to the projectId instead of 'Project' which caused the following problem:
	\- 'overdue'-menu doesn't get removed when it's empty and you refresh the page (only under the project-page)

+ Restructured and rewrote some html and css to make it easier to add pages (for example for a projects settings or createmenu)



Date: 20-5-2019

Date: 11-5-2019
++ Rewrote the @# system and added @users
	|- Active-checks are functional too

Date: 10-5-2019
+ Fixed: On TodoEditFinish the previous todo's html wouldn't be removed which resulted in having two times the same todo
+ Added: Started adding @users in 


Date: 9-5-2019
+ Fixed: When a todo is removed the system thinks it still exists because it only updates, it doesn't remove and re-add, (FRONTEND)
